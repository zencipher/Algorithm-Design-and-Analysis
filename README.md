## Known Issues
- [ ] Lab10 fails some test cases

### Additional Information
makefile should be changed to respective .cpp names, as they were set for how I submitted them.

#### Note of Warning
Instructors are beginning to use [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) to catch cheaters. If you are a student looking here with the intent of copying this code, proceed with caution.
